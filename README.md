  <ins> About the app </ins> 
</h4>

• This app was created with the idea to help you organize your social media work by creating tasks you have to do in a specific social network. The cool thing is that each network have a link to open the app without exiting the ToDo app and other thing, there is a lamp in each task to give you some hints about how to use and how to manage that social media to improve your work

• In the latest updates we added some features to help on the user experience(UX).

• We created a walkthrough screens at the time the app is opened to guide the user to use the app properly. You can acces these information in the hamburguer menu on the top left. In this menu, there are the changlog of the app too and other useful links.

• Another cool thing to help you is on the top right, there is a icon to acces our discord chat. The idea is to use the chat to ask questions about the app, about anything related to social media or just give feedback about the app and our mission is to use the chat to interact more with the user and our community
